If no mistake you have made, losing you are.
A different game you should play.
To answer power with power, the Jedi way this is not
In this war, a danger there is, of losing who we are.
In the end, cowards are those who follow the dark side.
Already know you that which you need.
Happens to every guy sometimes this does.
So certain were you.
Go back and closer you must look.
